###  GNU Wget
GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS, the most widely used Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/ buster main non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nonfree.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install
```

## Snap

What are Snap Packages?

Snaps are cross-distribution, dependency-free, and easy to install applications packaged with all their dependencies to run on all major Linux distributions. From a single build, a snap (application) will run on all supported Linux distributions on desktop, in the cloud, and IoT. Supported distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux, Manjaro, and CentOS/RHEL.

Snaps are secure – they are confined and sandboxed so that they do not compromise the entire system. They run under different confinement levels (which is the degree of isolation from the base system and each other). More notably, every snap has an interface carefully selected by the snap’s creator, based on the snap’s requirements, to provide access to specific system resources outside of their confinement such as network access, desktop access, and more.

Installation:

```bash
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install snapd
    
    $ sudo reboot
    
    $ sudo snap install core 
```

## Docker

Docker is a tool for creating, deploying, and running applications in containers. The software is popular among developers as it speeds up the development process and does not use a lot of resources.

Docker containers are lightweight, especially compared to virtual machines. This feature is especially valuable if you are a Raspberry Pi user.

If you need help installing Docker on your Raspberry Pi, read our step-by-step guide on how to install Docker on Raspberry Pi.
